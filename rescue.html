    <p style="color:skyblue"> I was in the dark in a box waiting to be found with my brother and sister. I could hear the pitter-patter of rain outside the box. Then a slit of light appeared in the top of the box and I saw a face looking down at me. They picked up the box and carried it away to a place with dogs in cages. Then after a couple days a group of people from Dallas Australian shepherd and herding dog rescue came and picked up my siblings and me, and took us to a safe home. I felt relived and happy. After two weeks in the foster home I went to a dog park with the nice lady who owned the foster home and met two new people. MY NEW OWNERS!</p> </body
